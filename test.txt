read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file 
descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf On
files that support seeking, the read operation commences at

the file offset, and the file offset is incremented by the number
of bytes read.  If the file offset is at or past the end of file,
no bytes are read, and read() returns zero.
